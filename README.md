# URLDB_Backend

Welcome to URLDB_Backend! This repository contains the backend codebase for the URLDB project, providing backend as a service. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on databases, models, and data, all managed through a robust backend system.

## About the Project

URLDB_Backend is built using Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. MongoDB serves as the database, providing scalability and flexibility for data storage. The backend is equipped with various middlewares to validate incoming data and handle authentication. With a plethora of APIs, developers can seamlessly create, read, update, and delete data entities.

## Repository Overview

URLDB_Backend is constructed with Express.js, harnessing the power of MongoDB for data storage. The repository contains middleware functions to validate incoming requests and ensure authentication. With a comprehensive suite of APIs, developers can perform CRUD operations efficiently.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication flow to access the backend services.
- **Authorization:** Granular control over user permissions for data operations.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected situations.
- **Middleware Stack:** Various middleware functions to preprocess incoming requests and ensure data integrity.
